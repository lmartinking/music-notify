Music Notify README
===================

What is..?

 Music notify is a simple hack that displays a popup/toast/thingie
 every time there is a change relating to your music. For example,
 volume changes, song changes, play/pause, etc are supported.

What it isn't!

 Music notify is completely passive! It is not meant to get in the way,
 and drive you nuts... Therefore, interactivity is not planned.

Requirements:

 Music notify uses libnotify <www.galago-project.org> for the
 display of the popups. As such, it is a dependency.
 
Available Backends:

 The following music-player backends (modules) are available:

 * mpd	- for the music player daemon
 * xmms	- for xmms and derivatives/cousins/etc
